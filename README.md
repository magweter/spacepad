## Our Mission

We’re building focused, fun tools for modern offices — tools that just work, without enterprise BS. Our values:
✅ Simplicity: Easy to deploy and use
🔐 Privacy-first: Self hosted and open source auditable
💸 Fair and sustainable: We offer paid features to keep development active
❤️ Designed with care: Beautiful on tablets, easy on the eye

## Features

We believe in open source and personal tinkering, and want to support these communities.

🙎‍♂️ If you’re a hobbyist or home user, enjoy Spacepad self hosted for free — even with multiple displays.

🏢 If you're a business using Spacepad in your office, we ask you to support development by [buying a license](https://spacepad.io/#pricing). It’s affordable, simple, and helps keep the project alive.
