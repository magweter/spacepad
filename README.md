## Quick Start

### Cloud Hosted Solution
Looking to get started for free with zero effort? Visit [spacepad.io](https://spacepad.io) to try out our cloud-hosted solution. We offer a free 7 day trial.
Cloud hosting is a great way to support this project for future development.

### Self-Hosted Option
We value the open source and self hosted communities. After all, your privacy and data should be protected at all costs.

To self host this application, you can deploy your own instance using Docker and Traefik out of the box.
Using other reverse proxies will also work, but might require a bit more configuration.

Get started setting up your own self hosted (production) instance:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/magweter/spacepad.git
cd spacepad

# Create the environment config
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the app key for the application:

```bash
# Linux
sed -i "s/^APP_KEY=.*/APP_KEY=$(php -r 'echo "base64:".base64_encode(random_bytes(32));')/" .env

# macOS
sed -i '' "s/^APP_KEY=.*/APP_KEY=$(php -r 'echo "base64:".base64_encode(random_bytes(32));')/" .env

# Windows (PowerShell)
(Get-Content .env) -replace '^APP_KEY=.*', "APP_KEY=$(php -r 'echo "base64:".base64_encode(random_bytes(32));')" | Set-Content .env
```

Now on to configuring the application:
1. Open the .env file and configure your domain and email.
1. Go to [Azure Portal - App Registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade/quickStartType~/null/sourceType/Microsoft_AAD_IAM)
1. Create a new app registration, only fill in a name and click 'create'
1. Open the 'verification' tab and create two new 'web' platforms:
    - https://your-domain.com/outlook-accounts/callback
    - https://your-domain.com/auth/microsoft/callback
1. Save, and click on 'API-permissions'
1. Click 'Microsoft Graph', delegated permissions and add `Calendars.Read.Shared`, `Place.Read.All` and `User.Read`.
1. Save, and click on 'certificates and secrets'
1. Create a new secret (not certificate) and copy the value
1. Click on 'overview' and copy the 'client id'. Beware: this is the client ID value you need, not the ID of the secret you just created.
1. Paste the values in the .env 'AZURE_AD...' variables

Now run the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Great! You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost.

Download the mobile app from the App Store or Play Store and follow the instructions üöÄ
